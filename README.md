## Description

 This was my first big project, which really used a lot of the languages I know until today in day that are that are html, css and Javascript. The project is basically a "carrocel of luxury cars", such as Lamborghini, Chevrolet, Ferrari, which shows a little of the history of each of them. Each section also has an index, which tells the user which section they are in, together with simple animations using css.

## Found challenges

 My main challenge was understanding how I could make the code as clean as possible, and also knowing exactly what would be the best way for this site to be responsive on mobile devices, and since I'm well accustomed to "mobile first" techniques, it wasn't such a time-consuming challenge to solve.

## What's did i learn?
  1. I learned good ways to make clean and well-optimized codes.
  2. I learned a new way of writing at the CSS which brought me much more organization.
  3. I improved my techniques a lot in "Mobile First"
