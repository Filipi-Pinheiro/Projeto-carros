# Projeto-carros

## Description

 This was my first big project, which really used a lot of the languages I know until today that are that are html, css and Javascript. The project is basically a "carrocel of luxury cars", such as Lamborghini, Chevrolet, Ferrari, which shows a little of the history of each of them. Each section also has an index, which tells the user which section they are in, together with simple animations using css.
